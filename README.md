The customized env is in file 'SMEnv'. You may have to register it to your local gymnasium package by copying the '__init__.py' and Folder 'SMEnv' to the conda environment path after you create the conda environment:
anaconda3\envs\smartmeter0\Lib\site-packages\gymnasium\envs
Here is a reference: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/626793890 if that doesn't work.

The .ipynb file contains the code for evaluating performance. You can just copy it to your jupyter working directory or colab.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Best regards,
